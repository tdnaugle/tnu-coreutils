### TNU Coreutils

This repo is my place to tinker with the GNU coreutils by writing some minimal functionality from scratch, and then using the commands on my personal machine, e.g. using `tnu-ls` instead of `ls`. My goal with this repo is to get a better understanding of both C and the GNU coreutils.
